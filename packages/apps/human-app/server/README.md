## Structure & Responsibilities: 
This is general structure of the project, not all components must be used, but in general classes should be placed in 
the appropriate directory and used in alignment with convention. 
#### Controller:
In this project one controller will be sufficient to handle all the requests from the frontend.
#### Module components:
Models represent business logic flow in the application. Each model is divided into following subcategories:
- Service - Main business logic class
- Mapper - Mapping between datatype, using nestjs automapper
- Module - Component managing the dependency injection
- Types - Custom types used in the module: see **Interfaces**
- Spec - Unit tests for the module
#### Common components:
Components shared between different modules and solving common concerns.
- Constants - Mocks, Enum and Error definitions
- Config - Injectable configuration service used to manage environment variables
- Pipes - Classes implementing the `PipeTransform` interface, used for common validation and transformation of data
nest js provides a lot of built-in pipes, check documentation before creating a new one.
- Gateway - Point of communication with external infrastructure (APIs)
- Utils - Common utility functions, that not met any criteria from other categories
- Filters - Classes implementing the `ExceptionFilter` interface, used to handle exceptions
- Interceptors - used to bind extra logic before/after method execution or extend behavior of the method
#### Interfaces:
Interfaces are used to define the shape and responsibility of the data:
- Dto - data sent from/to external sources and frontend, naming convention should include Request/Response part to indicate direction
- Domain - Datatype used for data manipulation in business logic
